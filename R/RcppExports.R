#' Perform agony computation. The software for agony computation 
#' (exact algorithm) adopted here was developed by Professor Nikolaj
#' Tatti and colleagues.
#' Agony is a measure of hierarchy within a directed graph.
#' Given a directed graph and a ranking metric (e.g., in our
#' case the time ordering of accumulation of driver alterations
#' during tumor evolution), any arc from nodes that are higher
#' in the hierarchy (e.g., alterations that occur in later stages
#' of the tumor) to nodes that are lower in the hierarchy
#' (e.g., alterations that occur at the initiation of the tumor)
#' are not expected and they are said to be causing agony.
